# Web Development Fundamentals (Self-Designed)

## Goal

To review and solidify my knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building websites and apps using the DOM, popular browser and HTML5 APIs, and modern design and development techniques.

I've already been doing web development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for several years, so the goal here is not to acquire new information as much as to clarify, classify, and concretize things I already know into a framework that will serve me going forward.
