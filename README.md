## Goal

To attain roughly a BS-level computer science education with a specialization in modern full-stack web development with data science applications in approximately 2-3 years using material available to the general public outside of a university setting.

I could probably go through all the material faster if I wanted, but my intent is to retain the material for future personal and professional use, not just to cover it all in a short period of time.

I will not be getting a degree for this work, and I probably won't take many of the courses for certificates (if any). The knowledge and skills are the point, not a piece of paper at the end.

I will also document my progress through each "term" in this repo to serve as a future resource for myself and anyone else who may be interested.

This will include the "ultralearning" method of essentially writing the textbook for each course as I take it, which should help me assimilate the material more quickly and thoroughly.

## Materials

I will be using a number of resources to create the curriculum:

- Open courses, course archives, and recorded lectures from university courses in CS, math, data science, and web development
- Books, preferably _legally_ available online (but I'll also definitely be buying some books).
  - Fortunately, in computer science and web development there are a large number of excellent books on many topics whose authors have generously made them freely available online
- Courses from providers like EdX, Coursera, Udemy, etc.
- Technical papers and journal articles (again, preferably freely available online)
- Tutorials, articles, blog posts, etc.

## Methodology

- Work on 4 courses at a time for 13 week "terms," completing all 4 within that time frame if possible.
  - Courses shorter than a full-term can be grouped (some courses I'm using are actually designed to be grouped in this way)
  - Longer courses may span more than one term; can group shorter courses with these in the last term to avoid time gaps
  - Working on multiple courses at once will leverage techniques to help with learning and retention, like spaced repetition and interleaving
  - Making the courses time-bound will alleviate my anxiety and ADHD/executive functioning issues that make open-ended projects difficult
- View all lectures for courses that have them available; otherwise use supplemental videos where appropriate
- Complete all readings, including textbooks (may substitute equivalent openly available book for required course textbooks), lecture notes, handouts, etc.
- Do all assignments, including projects, problem sets, presentations, and writing assignments
- Find and complete practice problems for every course unit to solidify the information
- Find and build related projects for as many course units as possible for the same reason
- Use supplemental resources when possible to more deeply learn or fill gaps in course materials
- Administer self tests, reviews, and quizzes at least once weekly for each subject
- Write reports on the material covered in my own words, as in the ["write your own textbook" ultralearning method](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning/)
- Where tests are available, take them all
- Use grading solutions and keys when available to evaluate course performance
- When necessary, grade myself (this is obviously not the preferred option)
- Build capstone application project at end of specialized web development curriculum
