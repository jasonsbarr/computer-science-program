## Goal

To attain a B.S.-level computer science education with a specialization in modern full-stack web development with data science applications in 1 year using material available to the general public outside of a university setting.

I intend to retain the material for future personal and professional use, not just to cover it all in a short period of time.

I will not be getting a degree for this work, and I probably won't take any of the courses for certificates or credit. The knowledge and skills are the point, not a piece of paper at the end.

I will also document my progress through each course on my website to serve as a future resource for myself and anyone else who may be interested.

This will include the "ultralearning" method of essentially writing the textbook for each course as I take it, which should help me assimilate the material more quickly and thoroughly.

## Materials

I will use the following resources to create the curriculum:

- Open courses, course archives, and recorded lectures from university courses in CS, math, data science, and web development
- Books, preferably _legally_ available online (but I'll also definitely be buying some books).
  - Fortunately, in computer science and web development there are a large number of excellent books on many topics whose authors have generously made them freely available online
- Technical papers and journal articles (again, preferably freely available online)
- Tutorials, articles, blog posts, etc.

## Methodology

- Work on 4 courses at a time until finished.
  - My focus will be on learning each course thoroughly, not necessarily on finishing the material in a particular time frame, but I will set prospective time frames for each set of courses to help me focus on daily progress and rapid assimilation of knowledge. 
  - Working on multiple courses at once will leverage techniques to help with learning and retention, like spaced repetition and interleaving
  - Making the courses sequential with a defined structure will alleviate my anxiety and ADHD/executive functioning issues that make open-ended projects difficult
- View all lectures for courses that have them available; otherwise use supplemental videos where appropriate
- Complete all readings, including textbooks (may substitute a similar book for required course textbooks when one is freely available online), lecture notes, handouts, etc.
- Do all assignments, including projects, problem sets, presentations, and writing assignments
- Find and complete practice problems for every course unit to solidify the information
- Find and build related projects for as many course units as possible for the same reason
- Use supplemental resources when possible to more deeply learn or fill gaps in course materials
- Administer self tests, reviews, and quizzes at least once weekly for each subject
- Write reports on the material covered in my own words, as in the ["write your own textbook" ultralearning method](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning/)
- Where tests are available, take them all
- Use grading solutions and keys when available to evaluate course performance

## Curriculum

Before starting the college-level math courses I will review algebra, geometry, and precalculus. I need a refresher because it's been 20 years since I graduated high school.

Most of the college-level courses I've plotted out are from MIT because they probably have the most extensive collection of online course material of any school. My program contains most of the required courses from the MIT Computer Science and Engineering degree program.

I've added some courses from other schools to make up for the few courses in MIT's curriculum that don't have sufficient online material. I've also added the intro CS sequences from Berkeley and Stanford because they cover topics I want to study more broadly and deeply than what MIT's core curriculum includes. Finally, I've added a few additional courses in core CS areas like operating systems, programming languages, and so on.

This all adds up to more courses than one would normally take to fulfill major requirements for a B.S. in CS degree, but I have room for some extra courses since I'm not doing any general education courses (I got plenty of that in my undergraduate program).
