# MIT 6.001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

## Goal

To provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
