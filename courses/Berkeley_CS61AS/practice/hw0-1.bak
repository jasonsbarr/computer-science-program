;; A line starting with a semicolon is a "comment".  You write
;; comments in order to explain in English what your code does, and
;; Racket knows to ignore comments since they aren't part of the
;; program.

;; This tells Racket that you want to use words and sentences (which
;; are disabled by default).
(require (planet dyoo/simply-scheme:2:2))

;; This tells Racket that it should "know" about all the functions you
;; define in this file.  (Don't worry about this for now.)
(provide (all-defined-out))

;; Exercise 0 - Introduce yourself

This is a comment that spans multiple lines.

1) What is your name?
Jason Barr

2) What is your major?
If I had one, it would be Computer Science

3) Are you a returning student? (i.e. Did you take 61AS last semester?)
Nope

4) What made you to take 61AS?
I wanted an intro course that focused on program design but _didn't_ use Python

5) Tell us interesting things about yourself.
I have a BA in music and finished the coursework for an MA in theological studies.

I play about 15 different musical instruments, depending on how you divide up percussion instruments.

I have the most amazing 5 year old son in the entire world. I'm sure every parent says that about their kid; it just so happens that my assessment is objectively correct. ;)
