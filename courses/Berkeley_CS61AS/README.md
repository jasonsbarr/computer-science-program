# UC Berkeley CS 61AS: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Goal

To teach about programming and software by mastering the techniques used for controlling program complexity. These include functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Course uses Racket/Scheme programming languages for most examples, plus some Python later in the course.
