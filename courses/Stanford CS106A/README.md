# Stanford CS 106A - Programming Methodology

## Goal

To introduce the engineering of computer applications emphasizing modern software engineering principles: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages.

### Note

The SEE version of the course is _really old_&mdash;like 2007 or 2008. I'll be using updated handouts, assignments, and exams from the most recent version(s) of the course with starter files that are compatible with the latest version(s) of Java.

## Course Materials

### Main

- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere MOOC](<https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs106a>)
  - This is a really old version of the course - at least 10 years
  - Lecture videos are the most useful thing here
  - Several lectures spend significant time discussing the obsolete ACM package but the concepts are still valid
  - Software downloads are long out of date

  - Updated software and assignment starters
  - Current handouts
- [Archived Spring 2018 course website](<http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1186/>)
  - In case materials from the current course offering, e.g. practice finals, aren't yet available when I need them
- [_The Art and Science of Java_](<https://www.amazon.com/Art-Science-Java-Eric-Roberts/dp/0321486129>) (main textbook)

### Supplemental
