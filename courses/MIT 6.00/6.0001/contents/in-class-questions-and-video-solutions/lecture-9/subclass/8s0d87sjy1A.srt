8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,930
ANA BELL: So I have here--
first part is just the top part,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,910
so I have some blank
line and then I'm

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,030
defining a method name speak.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,650
So write a line to
replace blank that

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,030
creates a class for a Dog
that inherits from Animal.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,740
So the first thing
I notice is that I

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,470
need to write a definition
for a class whose name is Dog.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,010
So my choices are these.

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,790
So I can tell it's either
the first or the third one.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,950
And then I want to
inherit from Animal,

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,530
so I don't want to
inherit from object

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,420
but I want to inherit
from Animal, right?

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,599
So that's perfect.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,970
Next question says, with
this definition of Dog,

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,460
you run a program with
those three lines.

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,900
What happens?

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,630
So this is my definition and
I have these three lines.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,900
Let's go down here.

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,600
Nice.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,100
OK.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,830
So with these three lines,
this first line says,

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,180
d is equal to Dog 7.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,980
So I'm creating a Dog
object with age 7.

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,470
Is this line going
to throw an error?

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,950
Well, this line actually
looks for an init method.

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,990
This particular class definition
doesn't have a init method,

34
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,930
but hey, I'm inheriting
from someone.

35
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,530
I'm inheriting from Animal.

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,570
Does Animal have an init method?

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,030
And it does, as we
saw in the slides.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,890
OK, so we're creating a new
Dog with age 7 and name none.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,390
So that line doesn't
throw an error.

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,720
The next line sets
the name to Ruffles.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,340
And again, I don't
have a set name

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,190
method inside this
particular class,

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,919
but does my Animal
class-- my parent class--

44
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,880
have a set name method?

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,430
And yes it does-- right here.

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,710
So I call that one.

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,690
So that line does
not throw an error.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,020
And the third line
says d.speak, which

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,450
is going to cause Python to
look in this current class

50
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,020
definition.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
And it says, hey, I have
a method here named speak,

52
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,340
so I'm going to use this one.

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,800
And it's going to print ruff
ruff, because it's a method,

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,697
so you can just--
it's like a function.

55
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:39,780
You can just print things.

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,920
You don't need to
return anything.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,243
So, perfect, most of you
are getting that right.
