00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,320
PROFESSOR: So for
this last class

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,920
exercise we have
this following code.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,750
So we have 46 for USA
gold, 27 for UK gold,

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,140
1 for Romanian gold.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,830
We make this variable,
here, Total Gold,

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,060
to be the sum of those
three which I believe is 74.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,240
Then we're going to
print total gold.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,007
OK?

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,340
Then we're going to increase
the value for Romanian gold

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,200
and we're going
to print it again.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,330
So as always, you can just
copy this, pop it into Python,

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,080
and run it to test yourself,
but you should do it just

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,650
in your mind first.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,670
So notice it print
74 in 74, and that's

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,470
because we never
told the program

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,400
to calculate the new total.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,020
So we only calculated the
total, way up here on line 5.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,790
If we calculated the
total again down here,

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,340
then it would be 74.75 So
let's look at the answers,

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,340
hopefully you guys got that.

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,200
Perfect, majority
are good to go.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,340
If you didn't get that
please try to review it,

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,620
review why it didn't work.
