ANA BELL: All
right, so let's see.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,170
So first we have L1 is
equal to bacon, eggs.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm going to short
form-- shorthand this.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,750
L2 is equal to toast and jam.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,500
Brunch-- I should actually
make these arrows-- brunch

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,340
is equal to L1.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,200
So this is just
aliasing, which means

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,290
brunch is going to point to
whatever L1 object points to.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,470
And if I do L1.append
juice, L1 is now

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,610
going to be bacon,
eggs, and juice.

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,720
OK?

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,240
This L1 has been
mutated to be that.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,610
And since brunch still
points to the same object

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,256
that L1 points to, brunch is
now going to point to there.

22
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,920
OK?

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,380
So when I do
brunch.extend L2, I'm

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,724
going to take whatever brunch
is, which is this part here,

25
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:31,344
and I'm going to extend it by
L2, which is toast and jam.

26
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:32,140
OK?

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,840
So it's just going to contain
a large list of those five

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,610
elements because of this
side effect issue, where

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,100
brunch was pointing
to the same thing

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,200
that L1 was pointing to, OK?

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,430
So it's close, but
I think-- perfect.

32
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,450
Yes, that's the right answer.
