ANA BELL: This is my
definition, including the method

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,570
to paint the car, so
to change its color.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,350
And the question says you create
a car with this line here.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,780
So you're initializing
it with 4 comma 2.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,050
What's a line of code that
changes the color from whatever

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,600
it initially is to red?

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,540
The first one,
car.paintred, is sort

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,270
of attempting to
do the way that we

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,770
saw in the right
in the slides where

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,930
you calling the class name dot.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,220
But it's missing the self.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,290
So we don't know what
object to call it on.

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,720
So that one's out
of the running.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,440
The second one is closer,
but we have red here as

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
a variable as
opposed to a string.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
So that one's not going to work.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,140
The third one looks good.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,390
And the fourth
one is just weird.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,240
I don't think that
one will work.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,250
It's attempting to
put a value for self.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,500
But you've already called mycar
dot instead of the class name

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,410
dot.

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,160
So here, this isn't
going to work.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,162
So since you already called the
object name dot method name,

32
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,620
you just have to give it the
other parameter that it needs,

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,370
which is the color.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,497
I think the majority
have gotten it right.
