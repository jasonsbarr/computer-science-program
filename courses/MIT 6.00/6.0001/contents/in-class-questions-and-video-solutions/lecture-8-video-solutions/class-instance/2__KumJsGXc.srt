8
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,830
PROFESSOR: We have
this definition

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,470
for the class object.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,100
I've created the init for you.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,690
And here I'm giving
it "self," which

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,610
is the first thing that
you have to give it,

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,200
and then two
parameters-- w and d.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,240
And for an instance
of a car, I'm

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,270
going to assign the data
attribute named wheels

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,790
to whatever is passed in for w.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,840
So notice that they're
not the same name.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,610
And the data
attribute for "doors"

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,760
is going to be the value
that's passed in for d OK?

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,910
And also notice
that inside init, I

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,550
can do any other sort of
initializations that I'd like.

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,240
So it's not just assigning
variables from the parameters

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,720
to variables for my objects.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,830
So in this case I'm creating
a new data attribute named

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,630
"color," and I'm
going to just create

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,950
it to be an empty string
OK, even though I didn't

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,377
pass in any color to my object.

28
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,710
So the question says, "Using
the class definition above,

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,330
which line creates
a new Car object

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,930
with 4 wheels and 2 doors?"

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,180
OK?

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:39,410
So this first one is
not right, because it's

33
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,920
trying to call the class with
a variable mycar for self,

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,760
which isn't quite right.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,970
So when you're
creating your object,

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,765
you have to give it one less
parameter than what you have.

37
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,640
So here we're just going
to have to create it

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,624
with the w and the d.

39
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:04,020
So we're going to create
this variable mycar

40
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,400
and we're going to assign it 4
for the number of wheels and 2

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,870
for the number of doors.

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,910
And the number of wheels
is the first parameter,

43
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,010
and the number of doors
is the second one,

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,880
so it should be this one
here-- Car 4 comma 2.

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,170
So that's this one.

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,720
Perfect.
