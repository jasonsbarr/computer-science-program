00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:24,040
PROFESSOR: So, which
of the following

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,820
is a good and valid definition
for a class representing a car?

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,790
OK, most of the people
I think have gotten it,

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,570
which is the red, which
says class car object,

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,180
and that's perfect.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,020
OK.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,750
So this defines a function,
this defines a class correctly,

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,190
but A is just not
descriptive name at all,

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,957
and this is kind of weird, and
this is the right one here.
