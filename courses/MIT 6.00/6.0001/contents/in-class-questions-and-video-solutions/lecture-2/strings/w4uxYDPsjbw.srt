ANA BELL: So I have
this variable name once,

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,890
which is umbr-- looks like
people are getting it.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,640
We have a variable called
repeat, which is ella,

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,650
and I'm creating a
variable u, which

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,430
is the concatenation of that
with the repeat multiplied

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,900
by 4.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,290
So I think people are on the
right track, seeing by the 90%

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,310
here.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,200
It's going to give me
this result right here.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,278
Great.
