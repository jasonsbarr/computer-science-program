ANA BELL: So we have x is
going to be whatever number

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,260
the user types in, y is
going to be whatever number

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,280
the user types in.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,540
First thing I'm going to
check is if x is equal to y.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,400
So if we type in x is 0 and
y is 5, 0 is not equal to 5,

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,100
so we're not even
going to consider

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,410
what's in this code block.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,885
Then we're going to check
the next one-- if 0 is

16
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:52,480
less than 5-- and that's true.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,730
So this is the very
first conditional

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,650
that evaluates to
true, so we're just

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,140
going to print x is smaller.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,160
And I think that's what's
being dragged down here.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,010
Awesome.
