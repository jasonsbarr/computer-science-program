00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,580
ANA BELL: So let's
look at the example,

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,610
or the in-class exercise,
with while loops.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,620
Oh good, we got some varying
responses here, perfect.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,940
So the code is, "You're
in the Lost Forest.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,990
Go left or right?"

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,680
OK.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,420
So here, the while
loop is checking

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,380
if the input is equal to
this particular string.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,010
OK.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,660
And if it is, type
the same thing again

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,700
and ask them for more input.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,720
So my question was, what happens
when you type in "R-i-g-h-t?"

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,850
And I think the majority of
the class is getting it right.

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,100
And maybe the
people who answered

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,470
this are maybe changing their
answer to something else,

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,250
but you're right.

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,976
So you ask the question
again, "Go left or right?"

25
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:11,350
And that's because
Python, again,

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,460
is very, very particular.

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,150
We're telling it
that the user input

28
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,400
must match this string exactly.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,280
So "R-i-g-h-t" is going to--
even though it says right,

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,380
it doesn't match up.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,440
So if you wanted-- I'll just
show you in this example here--

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,250
if you wanted to take
care of that case,

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,280
then you'd add this little--
you'd expand on this line right

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,510
here, which says, "while n = =
'right' or n = = to "R-i-g-h-t"

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,290
or whatever other cases
you'd want to take care of.

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,840
OK.
