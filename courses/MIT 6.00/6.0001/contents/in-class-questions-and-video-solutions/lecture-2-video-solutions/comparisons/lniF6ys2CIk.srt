ANA BELL: So I'm creating
a variable called pset_time

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,340
and I'm assigning it
to be the value 15.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,560
I'm creating a variable
named sleep_time.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,700
I'm assigning it
to be the value 8.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,050
I'm going to print the value
of this expression here.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,640
And the expression is a
conditional that says,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,230
is sleep_time greater
than pset_time?

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,830
So in Python, you're just going
to replace these variables

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,000
with their values.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,510
So is 8 greater than 15?

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,380
And that's false, so perfect.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,310
And then one operation on
Booleans derive as true.

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,680
Drink is false.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,850
I'm using the AND
operator to figure out

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,930
if I should drink
and derive, and I'm

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,440
going to print out false.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,050
So, perfect, people
are getting it.

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,813
Great job, guys.
