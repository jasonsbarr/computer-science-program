ANA BELL: So we're given
this definition for car.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,750
We saw that on the
previous slide.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,300
I want to add a
method that's going

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,650
to change the color of the car,
and these are my four choices.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,990
And it looks like you
guys are getting it

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,296
right, which is awesome.

14
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:45,670
So to find a method to change
the color of the car, which

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,110
does this.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,530
So we know that self has
to be the first parameter,

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,880
so we can automatically
eliminate A and C

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,214
and it's between B
and D. And remember

19
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:01,630
I said you have to be conscious
about whose data attribute

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,590
you're accessing,
and in this case,

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,150
we want to change the color of a
particular instance of the car,

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,840
right?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,500
So we have to say self.color
instead of just color.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,600
If we just said
color, then color

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,430
would refer to just a
variable inside the class,

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,950
not a data attribute
of a particular object.
