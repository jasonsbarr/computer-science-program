00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,520
ANA BELL: So we have a class
Car here, object as usual.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,260
The init method here takes in
self as usual, a w, and a d.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,470
So Car gets initialized
with two parameters.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,260
And we assign the wheels data
attribute to the first one

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,990
and the doors data
attribute to the second one.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,700
And then we're
going to also assign

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,460
the color data attribute
to be the empty string.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,042
So I'm giving you
four choices here.

16
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,750
And the question says,
which of the above

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,140
is a getter method for
the number of wheels?

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,840
So getter method
is something that's

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,250
going to get a data attribute.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,900
A method is really
just a function.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,110
So of course, we're
going to have def.

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,040
get_wheels is a
good name for it.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,610
Since it's a method
for this class,

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,520
we have to have self
in the parameters.

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,790
So we know it's going
to be between C and D.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,950
And so then what are
we going to return?

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,547
The first one's going
to return wheels, which,

28
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:25,130
in this particular
case, is just going

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,080
to be a variable that we haven't
defined, but it's a variable.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,310
A getter returns
a data attribute

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,270
of a particular instance.

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,990
So we actually have
to say self dot

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,400
if we want to return a data
attribute of an instance,

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,370
as opposed to just
a regular variable.

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,110
So the correct answer
is D. Great job.
