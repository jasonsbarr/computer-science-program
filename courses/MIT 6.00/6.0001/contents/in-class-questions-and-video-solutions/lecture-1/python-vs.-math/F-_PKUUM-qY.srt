00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,460
ANA BELL: So this next exercise
is which of the following

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,220
is allowed in Python.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,680
So x plus y is equal to 2.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,900
And again, these are all
things that you can just

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,980
type into Anaconda, which
is our IDE for the class,

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,600
and see whether it works or not.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,390
So this-- the first one is
probably not right-- let's

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,620
increase it a little
bit-- is not right

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,790
because the left side
needs to be a variable.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,130
This is not right because
it's an expression.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,530
This is not right because 2
is not a proper variable name.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,930
And xy-- that one's
actually going

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,270
to be OK because it's
not multiplication,

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,930
it's just the variable xy.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:14,130
So 50% said xy is equal
to 2, and that's right.

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,600
So none of these.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,810
So just to make sure
that you guys understand,

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,200
xy, this last one
here, is the right one

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,300
because xy is not x
times y, like in math.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,980
It's just one variable name that
has two characters, x and y.
