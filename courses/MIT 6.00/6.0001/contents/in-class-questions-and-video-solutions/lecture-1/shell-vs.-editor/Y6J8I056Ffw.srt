00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,877
ANA BELL: So the question was,
if you have these two lines

9
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:29,960
right here-- which I'll
just put them up here just

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,570
so it's bigger--
type(5), print(3.0-1),

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,060
what is going to be the output,
so if I run this in the editor?

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,842
So for these types of problems,
you can always check yourself.

13
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:43,050
And this comes back to, if
you're new to programming,

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,300
don't be afraid to try it out.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,850
Don't ask me.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,580
Don't ask your neighbor.

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,160
Just type it into the
shell and hit Run.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,570
And then you get to
see what the answer is.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,250
So the answer to this
question is going to be 2.0.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,260
And let's see, are we right?

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,280
Yeah, great.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,449
75% of the people got it right.

23
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:01,948
Perfect.

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,860
So if you didn't get it
right, just to explain again,

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,040
the reason why this
doesn't get printed out

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,670
is because we never actually
had a print statement.

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,910
So if you want to show
something to the console,

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,050
you need to use a
print statement.
