00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,570
ANA BELL: So let's see if you
can figure out this next error.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,140
Oh, nice.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,620
Looks like 100% are
getting it right so far.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,490
So we have L is equal to 3 for
i in range length L print i.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,140
And this is the error message
telling me the file, the line

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,330
number, and the actual
line that was wrong

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,390
and then a description
of the error type error.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,420
OK?

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,430
And everyone's getting
it right, which

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,940
is, what's the problem here?

18
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:00,530
We're not allowed to call
length on an integer.

19
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,190
OK?

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,921
If you go through
the other choices,

21
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,670
you'll see that those
you can actually do.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,490
And you can even test
those out yourself

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,381
before you settle
on the right answer.
