00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,370
ANA BELL: Let's walk through it.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,780
We have three lists.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,220
L1 is equal to [re].

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,630
L2 is equal to [mi].

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,570
L3 is equal to [do].

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,120
L4 is equal to-- let's just do
what it says here-- L1 plus L2.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,421
So it's going to be the list
[re, mi]-- uh, yeah, mi.

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,250
Now, extend() is going
to mutate the list.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,040
So that means L3 is going to
be extended by whatever L4 is.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,704
So L3 is going to be-- OK,
what did it have originally?

18
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,292
It had do.

19
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:09,750
And then, it's
going to be extended

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,050
by all of the elements inside
L4, which is re, mi, like that.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,030
And once I've mutated
it, the old version of L3

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,210
is gone, right?

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,350
This is the L3 down here
that I'm going to work with.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,380
L3.sort() is going to
sort alphabetically.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,310
So that's [do, mi, re].

26
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,640
Yep.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,740
And sort() also
mutates the list.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,690
So the old version of
the list I have is gone.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,250
del is going to also
mutate the list.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,440
So it's going to look
in L3, look at index 0,

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,620
and it's going to
delete that-- it's

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,380
going to delete that element.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,240
So it's going to mutate L3.

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,140
And it's going to
be [mi, re], OK?

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,760
And once again, I've
mutated the list.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,000
So the old version's gone.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,500
And lastly-- this is a tricky
part-- I'm going to append,

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,350
to my current L3, which looks
like this, another list.

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,050
So to L3, I'm
appending another list.

40
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,758
So this is going to be
the list [fa, la], OK?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,380
So [mi, re], and then the
list [fa, la] is the answer,

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,445
which is red-- no, sorry, blue.

43
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,160
Good, you had me scared.

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,120
OK.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,334
Perfect.

46
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,750
So if you didn't
get this, I would

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,063
suggest you go through
the Python tutor

48
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,354
or you just trace it out by
hand, just like I just did.

49
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,850
And hopefully it'll
be apparent, the more

50
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,960
exercises you do with lists,
what exactly is going on.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,510
OK.
