8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,860
PROFESSOR: We have
two strings, s1, s2.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,320
First, we're going to
check if the length of s1

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,630
is equal length 2.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,120
Anyone, really quickly
can you tell me what

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,666
is the length of s1 and s2?

13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,040
How many characters
are in there?

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,770
10 right, because
we're including spaces.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,417
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

16
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,750
so they are equal, first of all.

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,970
So we're going to go
inside this if statement.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,810
Then we're going to go
for every character in s1.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,650
And then we're going
to have a nested loop.

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,390
For every character
in s2, we're going

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,931
to check if the two characters
are the same, and if they are,

22
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,640
we're going to print this
common letter statement

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
and then we're going to break.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,540
OK.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,800
Great we have some
good competition here.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,620
So let's see.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,350
The outer for loop
is first going

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,550
to go through the
letter M. So this

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,090
is-- so first it's going
to look at M, right.

30
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,512
For char in s1, the first
character in s1 is an M.

31
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,470
Then we're entering inside
this other for loop.

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,660
For char 2 in s2.

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,700
So I'm going to
say for this M, I'm

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,690
going to look at I, which is
the first character in s2.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,910
If the character 1 is equal
to character 2, they're not,

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,990
don't do anything.

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,170
Keep going to the
next character in s2.

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,210
So that-- you don't
do anything there.

39
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,190
The next character
in s2 is a space,

40
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,060
M does not equal a space
so you don't do anything.

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,410
R does not-- the next character
is an R, don't do anything.

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,830
The next character is
a U, don't do anything.

43
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,182
Then an L, don't do anything.

44
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:15,390
Then an E, don't do anything.

45
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,860
Space.

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,690
And then suddenly
we get to an M.

47
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,650
So we're still in the outer for
loop, we're still looking at M,

48
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,730
and we're comparing M with every
other letter inside the s2.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,480
And suddenly we reach here where
we're comparing M with an M

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,710
and when we say
yes, they are equal.

51
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,830
So we're going to
print out something.

52
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,914
Make that into a better check.

53
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,330
We're going to
print common letter

54
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,680
and then we're going to break.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,370
This break says do
not keep looking

56
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,550
at the remaining letters in s2.

57
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,890
So once we've found
one that fits--

58
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,100
once we found one the
matches, stop right here,

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:07,000
break, and print out the thing,
and then go on to looking at I,

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,160
which is the next letter in s1.

61
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,850
And you do the same
thing, compare I with I,

62
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,710
we have a match.

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,600
Perfect, right off the bat.

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,750
So you print out
another common letter.

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,020
And then you break, which
means don't keep looking

66
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,850
at the remaining letters.

67
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,100
And then you look at-- since
you broke out of the inner loop,

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,210
you go to the outer loop.

69
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,640
The next letter is a
T and so on and so on.

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,230
So essentially you're comparing
every letter out here in s1

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,240
with every single
letter in s2 until you

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,500
find one that matches.

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,480
As soon as you do, you exit.

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,250
So if you actually
run this program

75
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,943
it's going to print out
seven times, I think.

76
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:50,905
We can check it.

77
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,690
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 times.

78
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:03,705
Nice.

79
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,430
The majority of the
people are right.

80
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,650
If you got this wrong,
please go back and try

81
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,000
to trace through your program.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,830
That means step by
step try to figure out

83
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,810
what values of
variables are just

84
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,820
to make sure that you're
on the right track

85
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,950
and you understand
exactly what's happening.

86
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,500
OK.
